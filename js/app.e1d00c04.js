as others in a similar situation, because of their race, the country where they were born, their ethnic origin or their skin color. Race discrimination in movies is one of the main topics. As in every country there are ethnic minorities, racial and ethnical discrimination appears in almost every region. Those minorities and ethnical groups are different from country to country; however, the essence of that discrimination is the same: discrimination based on race and ethnical background. In the countries that we chose, the racial discrimination is mainly depicted differently, however in some cases there are similarities. For the USA we chose the film “The Hate you Give”. It is about our times.The film illustrates the harsh reality of racial discrimination in America. The scenes are a true image of the pain that so many African-Americans suffer on a daily basis. It is about how people can be misunderstood incorrectly just because they are black, and because of those misconceptions they can be shot. This means that the stereotypes about race can actually be the reason that a person dies. In the film, a shooting of a black man happened, just because of the prejudice that exists around black people. The film shows that the voices of black men are not heard. Government doesntcare how many innocent black people are killed. In any case the rights of whites are privileged. The movie very obviously shows that in the same situation, when the black gay Khalil was killed, the police would never shoot if it would be a white person. This kind of racial discrimination is very common mainly in America. In the movie there is also a line that portrays typical American demonstrations against racial discriminations with a slogan “Black Lives Matters''. The British movie that we chose for racial discrimination is “Amazing Grace”. The discrimination here is similar to the one discussed above: again, it is a racial discrimination against blacks. However, there are a lot of differences. The thing that makes the comparison process harder is that “Amazing Grace” is about the 1800s and “The Hate you Give” is about our times. At the end of the 18th and at the beginning of 19th centuries in the England the slave trade was legal. The slaves were mainly black people and they were discriminated even under the law. A very dedicated lawyer and a member of senate William Wilberforce was fighting against the law and aimed to make slave trade illegal. This film shows how deep the racial discrimination was molded in the mentality of English people. Even during one of the scenes, one of the members of senate referred to Wilberforce by saying “are they people?”. This shows that blacks were not treated even as people, they were just the property of the whites. Even the time horizon is too broad, the similarities between American and English racial discrimination are obvious. They are mainly against black people. The rights of black people are not protected and the whites always have privileges. However, another similarity that is important to mention is, that a lot of white peoples in both countries are fighting against racial and mainly against black discrimination. This is a crucial aspect to understand the intentions of the people of both countries. On contrast in the other two countries there is no racial discrimination against blacks. This is logical, because of the history of those countries. Korea and India never had black racial minorities in their countries. Instead there are other type of discrimination and mainly that discrimination is seen not in those particular countries, but instead in other countries: for example, in the films that we chose “The Namesake” and “Gran Torino” the Indian and Korean ethnic groups are discriminated in America. This was one of the difficulties to compare the racial discrimination in these countries, however it is natural, because in Korea and India there are no racial diversities. In both films mentioned above, the immigrants are being discriminated against and considered as crime makers, just because of their race, just because they are different from the natives. In conclusion we want to mention that racial discrimination is difficult to compare in different countries, as that discrimination is not always expressed obviously. In the case of America and Britain, the films showed us that the racial discrimination was mainly against black communities. In contrast to this, we didn't observe obvious racial discrimination in Korea and India. This is mostly because the population in those countries are not ethnically diverse. The Korean and Indian people are being discriminated against in other countries, as the movies chosen showed.

Gender discrimination is one of the most widespread types of discrimination. Girls and women suffer most of the negative impact of rigid gender norms and roles - they are more likely to experience restrictions of their freedom and mobility, experience immense levels of violence and harassment across the globe, and have fewer opportunities to choose how to live their lives. Over the years, the world has gotten closer to achieving gender equality. There is a better representation of women in politics, more economic opportunities, and better healthcare in many places of the world. However, in a range of counties, gender discrimination still is an up-to-date problem and needs to be changed, which can only be done by reaching an equal level in surrounding countries. By watching and comparing these movies in these specific countries, we can raise our awareness of these bad habits and gradually move in the right direction. Also, to reach this level, both men and women should be united, having in mind the same idea. In the comparison of the gender discrimination levels between the US, Great Britain, India, and South Korea, we can notice that there are both similarities and differences regarding the different regions. This can be explained by the historical differences and backgrounds of each of those cultures. The movies cannot clearly demonstrate the history and the presence of gender discrimination in these specific areas as not everything can be depicted and illustrated in the film, but instead, movies can concentrate on a particular aspect of discrimination that is the most visible in the timespan when the events were taken place. At the same time, however, movies can convey the general concept by showing the essence of it in a specific moment of a time.For example, in the movie “Suffragette,” women are fighting for their rights to vote, and they hope that with that their role in society will be more, and they will reach a level where they would not be subjected to work only in the laundry or other such places as the majority of them are working and are treated like the ones inferior to men. In movies “On the basis of sex” and “Kim Ji Young: Born in 1982,” the women are trying to change something to be treated as an equal with men and simultaneously making the strong fundament for changing mindsets of people about gender discrimination. And if there were not the factor of their husbands who were always there to help them and support, they would not be able to change anything and reach so far. So, we may assume from here that to change the gender discrimination, the actions of females are not sufficient enough and to reach a radical change, both men and women should be actively involved in the process of fighting discrimination. As not everyone was thinking and nurtured in the same manner and culture, the ones who realize the importance of this issue and the wrongness of sorting people out of their gender should try to raise the awareness of the society, and without it, the changes cannot be radical. There are also differences in the way gender discrimination is expressed in some different regions as we believe that it comes from a diverse background of a people and the historical factor of those specific countries. If we relate the movie “Bend it like Beckham” with “Suffragette,” we can see that in the UK, females were treated as a second sort and men were always trying to dominate them, but if were making a parallel to the other film, we can notice that females are trying to resist and struggle to their families and culture as they insist that there it is a universal truth of their culture and they should not do in another manner. Besides all of that, we should also take into account that these two movies represent two different timelines, and there are about a hundred years of difference, which is a lot for certain behaviors to change dramatically. ")],-1)})),ge={class:"race text-container"},ve=ue((function(){return Object(n["e"])("h2",null,"Religion",-1)})),ye=ue((function(){return Object(n["e"])("p",{class:"text-info"},' Religious discrimination is treating individuals differently because of their religious beliefs and practices and/or their request for accommodations of their religious beliefs and practices. It also includes treating individuals differently because of their lack of religious beliefs or practices. Religious discrimination is quite controversial. Based on the movies we saw; we have derived that religious discrimination can come in many forms. It can range from people being discriminated against based on what religions they belong to and their spiritual habits, or whether they have completely diverse belief systems, such as choosing nature over God\'s existence or having agnostic views. Furthermore, religious discrimination does not recognize scales: it does not always have to extend either national or international levels. People can face religious discrimination even within the small scale of their families. In the movies, religious discrimination had both differences and similarities based on the chosen countries. The differences and the similarities, we suppose, are based on the history of that specific country, its culture, and traditions. The movie we have chosen to represent USA\'s religious discrimination is "The God is Dead". The movie had two religious aspects: a university student was being discriminated against for his Christian views by an atheist philosophy professor, and a girl who got kicked out of her home because of her religious beliefs. In the first case, the philosophy instructor on the first day of classes made his students sign papers that the topic of God\'s existence would be avoided during the semester, promising that the students would be able to bypass the section of the class that they got the lowest grade for. If they refuse to write the sentence "God Is Dead" and put their signature under it, they will lose thirty percent of their final grade. Out of sixty people present, only one Christian student opposed. As a matter of fact, those fifty-nine students did not even question the professor\'s requirement; they either were religiously unaffiliated or atheists as well. This we can directly link to the US statistics and history of religion, claiming that atheists make up approximately one-fifth of the US population. We do believe that the reason of the above-mentioned statistics and discrimination type in the film is largely based upon the ethnic diversity of the US population. Moreover, taking into account the forward-looking viewpoints of the US people, the most probability of experiencing this type of religious discrimination are the US communities. This is why religious discrimination of this type is not seen in other countries that we examined. The second case of religious discrimination in the movie was about a girl that came from a traditional Muslim immigrant family but failed to be a "deserving" daughter for her father. She did not take the religion that her father passed to her as an innate part of her identity, rather challenged her mindset to understand what religion she belongs to, i.e. Christianity. Because of this she got kicked out of her own house by her father, who chose his religious identity over being a father. We have also encountered this type of discrimination when examining Korea and the movie "Minari". In that case, we also saw the family as an indirect educational institution and directly influences a child\'s religious orientation. The two kids were constantly told to pray whenever necessary and whenever not, and if they didn\'t pray hard enough and frequently enough, they would be punished by their mother. This discrimination and also the discrimination towards the above-mentioned Muslim girl are examples of within-family discrimination. Of course, the moral upbringing that people from their families has an impact on what an individual grows up into. But in these two cases, the discrimination is apparent. Parents forcefully make their offspring profess their religion and do not accept otherwise. The more large-scale discrimination is portrayed in the other two films: in the case of India and Britain. In both cases, religious discrimination is towards a specific group of people. In the case of India, Muslims are a religious minority compared to Hindus, and the film "My Name is Khan" depicted the discrimination that Indian Muslims face because of it. Similarly, in the case of Britain, we see a general pattern of discriminating against Muslim minorities based on the "Blinded by the light" movie. These discriminations are large-scale and come from the background of the countries. In the case of Korea, we see a difference: because Korea has comparatively less ethnic diversity, their religious discrimination is primarily family-based. In contrast, in the two countries mentioned above, Muslim minorities\' discrimination based on the movies is against the whole group of people. To sum up, we would like to mention that drawing parallels between these countries religious discriminations is not an easy thing to do, because one discrimination that we saw, for instance, in case of America, can also be found in, lets say India, because discrimination is not uniform or specific for each country. However, as the chosen movies indicated, the religious discrimination that US citizens mainly face relates to atheism. While in India and Britain, the discrimination is against a larger group, for instance against Muslims. What refers to Korea, the religious discrimination there, is largely family-specific.
